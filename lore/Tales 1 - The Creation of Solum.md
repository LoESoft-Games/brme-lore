Many years ago, three mighty gods planned the creation of a brand-new world that could keep their most unusual and creations. They decided to add an unusual continent, so that all creations could live, thus was created the continent of Solum.

The Gods created there most prized possession, humans. To help them thrive, plants and animals were added in abundance. As a final gift the Gods blessed them with their incredible powers.

Perverus, the God of strength, has given strength to be dominant over adversity. Sapier, the God of wisdom, has bestowed pride for inner and mental growth along with intelligence so that they can master any teaching passed unto them. Finally, Virbus, the God of bravery, granted the virtue that along with the vigor do not let themselves be so easily subdued or dominated.

After the bestowal of the divine gifts, the gods ceased to exist, so that humans could begin their journeys alone and discover the most unusual creations the Gods left on the vast and unknown continent of Solum.
